# PlayHazards

## A Play to Earn (P2E) NFT-based gaming platform on Monad powered with Groq.

---

## 📌   Introduction

**We created PlayHazards, featuring three distinct games—Dungeons & Dragons-inspired (DnD), Chimp Test, and Memory Matrix, to tackle the issue that traditional gaming offers no real-world value for players’ efforts, with in-game achievements like quest rewards or high scores trapped in the game’s ecosystem. Our Play to Earn (P2E) model lets players earn cryptocurrency tokens by completing epic quests in the DnD game, mastering cognitive challenges in Chimp Test, or excelling in pattern recognition in Memory Matrix, providing tangible rewards despite our NFTs being non-tradable. This makes gaming inclusive, especially for players in regions where it can serve as income, empowering them economically.**

## Challenges

We ran into several hurdles while building PlayHazards, our web3-based P2E NFT gaming platform featuring three games: a Dungeons & Dragons-inspired (DnD) adventure, Chimp Test for cognitive challenges, and Memory Matrix for pattern recognition. The biggest challenge was integrating Groq AI for real-time game logic across these games, getting AI-driven features like adaptive enemies in DnD, dynamic difficulty in Chimp Test, and personalised puzzles in Memory Matrix to work smoothly with the Monad blockchain was a technical nightmare, requiring us to optimise for low latency under tight deadlines.

On top of that, the hackathon’s time crunch meant we were racing against the clock, leaving little room to polish features or test everything as thoroughly as we wanted. Despite these obstacles, we pushed through, learning tons and making PlayHazards a reality we’re proud of.
